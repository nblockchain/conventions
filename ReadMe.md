This is a repository that contains several useful things that
other `nblockchain` repos use, such as:

- File with commitlint configuration and plugins.
- A reference .editorconfig.
- An F# style guide.
- Workflow guidelines.

All in all, this is mainly documentation, and some tooling to
detect bad practices.

More things to come:
- Detect .fsx files without shebang or +x attrib.
- Detect files with mixed line endings.
- Detect use of -latest in `runs-on:` GitHubCI tags.
- Detect old versions of FSharpLint and fantomas/fantomless
being used.
