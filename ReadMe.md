This is a repository that contains several useful stuff that
other nblockchain repos use, such as:

- File with commitlint configuration and plugins
- A reference .editorconfig
- An F# style guide
- Workflow guidelines

All in all, this is mainly documentation, and some tooling to
detect bad practices.

More things to come:
- Detect EOF without EOL in files.
- Detect files with mixed line endings.
- Detect use of -latest in `runs-on:` GitHubCI tags.
- Detect old versions of FSharpLint and fantomas/fantomless
being used.
